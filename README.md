# iterator-utils

## Description

A direct port of the well-known python builtin library `itertools` and some extra iterator utility functions I find useful. Parts inspired by [itertools.js](https://github.com/nvie/itertools.js).

Some functions are still untested, use with caution.

## TODO

- [ ] finish this README.md
- [ ] more tests
- [x] port all functions from `itertools`
- [ ] as well as `more-itertools` (90%)
- [ ] write JSDocs
- [ ] more iterator utilities I find useful
- [ ] proper docs
- [ ] (optional) implement Rust `std::iter::Iterator` somehow
