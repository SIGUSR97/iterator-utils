# iterator-utils

## Description

A direct port of the well-known python builtin library `itertools` and some extra iterator utility functions I find useful. Parts inspired by [itertools.js](https://github.com/nvie/itertools.js).

## TODO

- [ ] finish this README.md
- [ ] write tests
- [ ] port all functions from `itertools` as well as `more-itertools`
- [ ] write JSDocs
- [ ] more iterator utilities I find useful
- [ ] (optional) implement Rust `std::iter::Iterator` somehow
