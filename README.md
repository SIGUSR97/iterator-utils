# it-utils

## Description

A direct port of the well-known python builtin library `itertools` and some extra iterator utility functions I find useful. Parts inspired by [itertools.js](https://github.com/nvie/itertools.js).

Some functions are still untested, use with caution.

## TODO

- [ ] finish this README.md
- [x] rename/republish this repo
- [ ] more tests
- [x] port all functions from `itertools`
- [ ] as well as `more-itertools` (90%)
- [ ] JSDocs
- [ ] more iterator utilities I find useful
- [ ] implement Rust `std::iter::Iterator` somehow (90%, need tests)
- [ ] split into submodules (iterator-utils, reversible, rs-iterator)
- [ ] better rollup settup?
- [ ] code comments
- [ ] automated workflow with CI/CD (CircleCI or Travis CI?)
- [ ] rename files to fit new package name
- [ ] rename this repo as well
